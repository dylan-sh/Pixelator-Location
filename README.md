# Pixelator (Modified)

![alt text](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fSrxqtw0si8/maxresdefault.jpg)

This is a modified version of Pixelator for the purpose of being able to execute for a specific X, Y, Z location. It was created for my personal project [DalleMC](https://github.com/dylan-sh/dallemc).

The usage is "/pixelator "<image>" x y z", whereas the unmodified usage is /pixelator "<image>" with the location being the player's location.
